# SurfsUp_Challenge

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether or not the weather patterns in a specific location in Hawaii are suitable for the opening of a surf shop in the area, looking specifically at weather in the months of June and December, so as to take a look at a typically warm month and a typically colder month.

## Results

The weather in Hawaii is, unsurprisingly, pretty nice.

  - The weather in June is, on average, about three degrees (F) warmer than that of December.
  - The lowest recorded temperature in December is 8 degrees colder than that of June.  The Standard deviation of December temperatures is also slightly higher, which indicates that December weather is a bit more volatile than June.
  - The 25, 50, and 75% quartiles for both months are within two or three degrees of each other.  So, aside from the odd cold snap in December, the weather is nice all year round.

## Summary

From the data analysis looking at opposite ends of the year, it would appear that the weather as measured in Hawaii is suitable for surf and sun all year round.  However, being that Hawaii is an island chain in the middle of the pacific ocean, it may not have the same sort of seasonal weather patterns as, say, Detroit.  While I experience a regular cycle of four seasons, many places around the world, especially those nearer the equator, experience dry and rainy seasons, or a short monsoon season at a regular interval.  As such, it would be wise to expand the analysis to repeat the data queries for all twelve months in the year, to get a clearer picture of the totality of Hawaiian weather patterns.  Additionally, as an oceanic island chain, it would also be wise to analyse rainfall and wind patterns to determine if there may be times when temperatures are nice, but rain or high winds spoil the beach fun.
